                                 " A great place! We buy all our fruits from this market because it is almost always local and reasonably priced! My wife and I are from Zadar and we were sad when the Fit Market changed hands and became just another grocery store. When we moved up here a few years ago it was so nice to find a true local market to buy from again! "
